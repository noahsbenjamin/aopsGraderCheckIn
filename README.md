# aopsGraderCheckIn

## Ideas for Version 1
* Each month create new columns and section for most recent months data. Grab data and copy it here.
* Archive anything older than 1 year in another sheet?
* Calculate averages of months since last check-in
* Pull survey data into the sheet and organize what was checked.
* Pull relevant data into main sheet from survey (e.g., newest Front link - though we want these to stay the same, date of review)
   * We may want to search Front links for different ones and add them, if they exist, as a note in the cell that has the newest Front link

## Ideas for Version 2
* Create and send template email based on what is checked in the form
  * Could explore using a Google Doc for writing and updating template or sheet
* Generate reminders for rolling check-ins
